# OnlineClassBot
Simple Telegram Bot that gets the list of online classes propoused by my Uni and send the ones i need to attend, every day, in a specific Telegram Channel.

There are two slightly differnt versions:
 - botOnce.py: bot that you have to manually run every time you want to receive the message of yours tomorrow Online Classes.
 - bot.py: bot that needs to be run once and every day automatically send the specific message.

For Web Hosting i used [pythonanywhere](www.pythonanywhere.com), a free and and easy to use option.
